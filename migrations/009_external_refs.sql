-- 009: External reference map
--
-- Records which foreign record a quality-control row came from, so an import can
-- be re-run without duplicating rows and a row can be traced back to its source.
-- Warehouse has carried this table since its receipts work; quality control had
-- no equivalent.
--
-- target_id is TEXT even though this service keys its tables with bigserial. It
-- is a correlation key, not a foreign key, and the services this map spans do
-- not agree on a key type — procurement, CRM and fleet use text, finance and ERP
-- use uuid, quality control uses bigint. Text represents all of them without
-- loss and keeps one table shape across every service; a bigint target is stored
-- as its decimal rendering.
--
-- origin records which side last wrote the row: a relay importing from another
-- system stamps its own label, and a relay running the other direction skips
-- those rows. Without it two relays echo each other's writes indefinitely.
--
-- source_version is the source's own monotonic cursor for that record, so a
-- replayed or out-of-order change can be recognised as stale and dropped rather
-- than overwriting newer data.
